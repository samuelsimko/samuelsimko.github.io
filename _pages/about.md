I am a MSc Computer Science student at ETH Zurich, where I recently completed my Master's thesis on adversarial defenses,
under the supervision of Prof. [Zhijing Jin](https://zhijing-jin.com/home/),
Prof. [Mrinmaya Sachan](https://lre.inf.ethz.ch/) and Prof. [Bernhard Sch√∂lkopf](https://is.mpg.de/~bs).

Supported by OpenPhilanthropy, my current research focuses on developing tamper-resistant safeguards for large language models.
More broadly, I am interested in adversarial defenses, jailbreaking attacks, misalignment detection, and causal inference.
In the past, I have also worked on projects in computational cosmology and AI for healthcare.

Outside of research, I am an avid [speedcuber](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2016SIMK01).
I have also participated and won prizes in several [GraySwan Arena](https://app.grayswan.ai/arena) manual jailbreaking contests.
